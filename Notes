We'll use the same User Class for attendees, staff, and organizers. We would have
use the concept of polymorphism by overriding each class for each type but that would be complex
for our use case.

     fetch = FetchType.LAZY:
     This specifies the fetching strategy for the associated User entity. FetchType.LAZY means
     that the User object (organizer) will only be loaded from the database when it is explicitly
     accessed for the first time. This is the recommended approach for performance optimization, as it avoids
     loading unnecessary data when the organizer might not be needed in a particular operation

User and Event Entites are important to understand the schema things.

//    A servlet in Java is a server-side component written in the Java
//    programming language that extends the capabilities of a server,
//    typically a web server. Servlets are a fundamental technology
//    in Java web development, particularly for building dynamic web applications.
Request-Response Model:
They are designed to handle client requests (primarily HTTP requests from web browsers) and generate
dynamic responses (like HTML, XML, or JSON) to send back to the client.
